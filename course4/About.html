    <H2>About my work</H2>
    <p><a> My work explores the people, folklore, mythology, and culture of my native Peru through diferent mediums, like oil, acrylic and watercolors. My goal with my art is to promote intercultural exchange and appreciation between Andean and American cultures, which are incredibly divergent and yet have similar roots. With my current collection of paintings, I want to bring attention to the cultural contrast bewen  people from difent latitudes. This collection of work is inspired by the unique landscape of my hometown, the strong colors of which stand in stark contrast to the brown and green tones of the Andes Mountains.

        This colection also containg some pieces, wich subject matter is the traditional andean textiles of the Cuzco region. As a first step for this project to better understand the weaving tradition, I met with Quechua weavers and learned from them the details and process of weaving textiles and symbols. I also learned through practice how textiles are organically dyed by hand from natural substances found in the mountains. With a practical understanding of textile development and storytelling through symbols, I was ready to begin my own interpretation of this art form.</a></P>
        <p><a>Photography is the art of capturing images by recording light,time, and physical
            form. My photography is based on scenes from my daily life, and mostly from my
           travels. I love to capture the seasonal changing of the landscape, 
             and nature's elements, and I like to record the energy and atmosphere 
         that is visually appealing, and sometimes just to have a memory.</a></p>
