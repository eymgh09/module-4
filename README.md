BIULD A ACCESIBLE FIVE PAGE WEBSITE.
This project consists of building a web page, made up of five pages, containing at least one image and one video, the idea is to have the same structure on each page and at least contain a contact form. For this project I decided to build a virtual gallery regarding my art work, and thus show the collection in which I am working.
