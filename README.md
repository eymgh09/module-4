BIULD A ACCESIBLE FIVE PAGE WEBSITE.
This project consists of building a web page, made up of five pages, containing at least one image and one video, the idea is to have the same structure on each page and at least contain one contact form. For this project I decided to build a virtual gallery regarding my art work, and this way show the collection in which I am currently working on.
